So could be physical, it could be internal like \"I'm smart, I'm funny, I'm ambitious, I'm driven.\" Writing things out helps so much - if I don't write it out like I will never think about it again cuz my brain's just like overloaded all the time. This might seem like a really trivial exercise, truly writing things down like this is what works the most. At least not even just for me but it's like a scientific fact - if you write things out, it's more likely to be true.",
      "cn": "这是一种提升自我认知的方法，你要做的就是写下\"我是\"的陈述句。这些陈述可以是关于外表的，也可以是内在的，比如\"我很聪明、我很幽默、我很有抱负、我很有干劲\"。把事情写下来真的很有帮助，如果我不写下来的话，我就再也不会去想它了，因为我的大脑总是处于超负荷状态。这可能看起来像是一个很简单的练习，但说实话，这样把事情写下来是最有效的方法。不仅对我来说是这样，这简直就是一个科学事实，如果你把事情写下来，它就更有可能成为现实。"
